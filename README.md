# netflix-ish
seeking to try my hand at creating a more interactive website, i used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to tackle the netflix landing page with some original changes

- rather than redirection to a separate sign up page, multi-step modals obtain user information
- customized client-side validation responds readily to user input was implemented
- small feedback animations better guide the user
- responsive to different screen sizes
