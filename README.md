# netflix-ish
seeking to try my hand at creating a more interactive website from scratch, i combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to tackle the netflix landing page... with some original changes! 

- rather than redirecting to a separate sign up page, multi-step modals were created to obtain user information
- customized client-side validation that responds readily to user input was implemented
- small feedback animations were added to better guide the user
- the site is responsive to different screen sizes
- data on new users are sent to local storage 
- all buttons are clickable!
